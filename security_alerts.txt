SECURITY ALERT SUMMARY - Enhanced Gateway Scraper
=================================================
Date: 2025-07-12 21:24:00
Severity: HIGH

CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES:
==========================

1. REDIS SECURITY COMPROMISE ATTEMPT
   - Issue: Cross Protocol Scripting (CPS) attacks detected
   - Frequency: Every ~70 seconds
   - Source: 172.21.0.5 (internal Docker network)
   - Impact: Redis instance security compromise
   - Action Required: IMMEDIATE - Secure Redis with authentication

2. PRODUCTION SECURITY WEAKNESSES
   - Issue: Application running in debug mode
   - Risk: Information disclosure, performance impact
   - Warning: "Running in debug mode. Switch to release mode in production."
   - Action Required: Set GIN_MODE=release

3. UNSAFE PROXY CONFIGURATION
   - Issue: Trusting all proxies (not safe)
   - Risk: Security vulnerability through proxy manipulation
   - Warning: "You trusted all proxies, this is NOT safe."
   - Action Required: Configure specific trusted proxies

CONFIGURATION MISMATCHES:
==========================

1. GUI-API CONNECTION FAILURE
   - Issue: GUI cannot connect to main API endpoints
   - Failed Endpoints:
     * /api/v1/metrics
     * /api/v1/stats
     * /api/v1/health
     * /api/v1/proxies/scrape
     * /api/v1/gateways/scan
   - Root Cause: GUI pointing to wrong API server
   - Action Required: Fix GUI API endpoint configuration

2. NETWORK ERROR THRESHOLD EXCEEDED
   - Issue: High network error count detected
   - Impact: System performance and reliability
   - Action Required: Investigate network configuration

RUNTIME PANICS/CRASHES:
=======================
Status: NO RUNTIME PANICS DETECTED
- All processes running normally
- No stack traces found in logs
- No core dumps detected

CONNECTION STATUS:
==================
✅ ClickHouse Database: Connected Successfully
❌ Discord Integration: Not verified in logs
⚠️  Redis Cache: Connected but under attack
❌ GUI-API Communication: Failed
✅ Main API Server: Running on port 8083
✅ GUI Server: Running on port 8081

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
===========================
1. Secure Redis instance with authentication
2. Investigate IP 172.21.0.5 for CPS attacks
3. Set application to production mode
4. Fix GUI-API endpoint configuration
5. Configure proper proxy trust settings
6. Review and update security configurations

MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS:
==========================
1. Set up Redis security event monitoring
2. Monitor API endpoint availability
3. Track network error rates
4. Implement structured logging alerts
5. Regular security audits

Status: SECURITY REVIEW COMPLETE
Priority: HIGH - Immediate action required for security issues
