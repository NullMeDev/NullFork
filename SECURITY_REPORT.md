---

## 2. Critical Security Findings

### üö® Extremely Dangerous Permissions

The extension requests the following **CRITICAL** permissions that enable malicious activities:

| Permission | Risk Level | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| `<all_urls>` | üö® EXTREME | Access to **ALL WEBSITES** on the internet |
| `proxy` | üö® EXTREME | Can intercept and modify **ALL NETWORK TRAFFIC** |
| `webRequest` | üö® EXTREME | Can monitor and block web requests |
| `webRequestAuthProvider` | üö® EXTREME | Can handle authentication requests |
| `scripting` | üö® HIGH | Can inject arbitrary code into web pages |
| `declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess` | üö® HIGH | Can modify network requests |
| `tabs` | ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM | Can access browser tab information |
| `webNavigation` | ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM | Can track navigation events |
| `system.cpu` | ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM | Can access CPU information |
| `system.memory` | ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM | Can access memory information |
| `storage` | ‚ÑπÔ∏è LOW | Can store data locally |
| `alarms` | ‚ÑπÔ∏è LOW | Can set periodic alarms |

### üéØ Payment Fraud Infrastructure

The extension specifically targets payment security systems:

**Blocked Domains** (from `analytics_rules.json`):
- ‚úÖ `r.stripe.com` - Stripe payment processing
- ‚úÖ `q.stripe.com` - Stripe analytics
- ‚úÖ `geoissuer.cardinalcommerce.com` - Cardinal Commerce fraud prevention
- ‚úÖ `h.online-metrix.net` - ThreatMetrix fraud detection

**These blocks disable security measures that protect against payment fraud.**

## 3. Code Analysis Results

### üîí Heavy Obfuscation
Despite deobfuscation efforts, the code remains heavily obscured:

| File | Hex Values | Array Lookups | Status |
|------|------------|---------------|---------|
| `background.js` | 47,582 | 41,248 | Heavily obfuscated |
| `main.js` | 31,700 | 27,405 | Heavily obfuscated |
| `popup.js` | 41,153 | 34,666 | Heavily obfuscated |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Suspicious Code Patterns
- Function() constructor usage (dynamic code generation)
- String.fromCharCode usage (character encoding/decoding)
- Extensive hex value usage (obfuscated constants)
- Array-based string lookups (hidden strings)

---

## 4. Attack Capabilities

Based on the permissions and code analysis, this extension can:

### üåê Network Interception
- **Intercept ALL web traffic** using proxy permissions
- **Modify requests and responses** in real-time
- **Steal authentication tokens** and session data
- **Bypass SSL/TLS protections** through proxy manipulation

### üí≥ Payment Fraud
- **Disable fraud detection** by blocking security services
- **Modify payment forms** to bypass CVV validation
- **Steal credit card information** during transactions
- **Inject malicious code** into payment pages

### üïµÔ∏è Data Collection
- **Monitor browsing activity** across all websites
- **Access sensitive data** from all web pages
- **Track user behavior** and navigation patterns
- **Collect system information** (CPU, memory usage)

### üé≠ Stealth Operations
- **Hide malicious code** through heavy obfuscation
- **Execute dynamic code** to avoid detection
- **Operate silently** in the background
- **Evade security scans** through code complexity

---

## 5. Deobfuscation Results

### ‚úÖ Successful Improvements
- Applied basic string decoding
- Identified function patterns
- Enhanced code formatting
- Exposed some array structures

### ‚ùå Remaining Challenges
- **120,435+ hex values** still obfuscated across all files
- **103,319+ array lookups** hiding string constants
- Dynamic code generation patterns
- Complex encoding schemes

**The core malicious functionality remains hidden in the obfuscated code.**
