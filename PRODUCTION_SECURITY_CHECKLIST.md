# Production Security Checklist

## Configuration Changes Made

### 1. Environment Files Security
- ✅ Fixed syntax error in global `.env` file (DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID)
- ✅ Updated `.env` file permissions to 600 (owner read/write only)
- ✅ Updated enhanced-gateway-scraper `.env` file permissions to 600
- ✅ Added production-specific environment variables

### 2. Production Environment Settings
- ✅ Changed `CLICKHOUSE_DSN` to use Docker service name: `clickhouse:9000`
- ✅ Set `LOG_LEVEL=ERROR` for production (reduced verbosity)
- ✅ Set `PRODUCTION_MODE=true`
- ✅ Enabled `ENABLE_API_AUTH=true`
- ✅ Enabled `ENABLE_TLS_VERIFICATION=true`
- ✅ Added secure Grafana admin password

### 3. Volume Structure Verification
- ✅ Confirmed `data` directory exists and is writable
- ✅ Confirmed `results` directory exists and is writable
- ✅ Confirmed `configs` directory exists and contains configuration files
- ✅ Created `backups` directory for automated backups

### 4. Docker Compose Security
- ✅ Updated docker-compose.yml to use `.env` file instead of hardcoded values
- ✅ Added `env_file` directive to services
- ✅ Made Grafana admin password configurable through environment variables

## Security Recommendations for Production

### 1. Secrets Management
- [ ] Replace placeholder passwords with strong, generated passwords:
  - `API_AUTH_TOKEN`
  - `CLICKHOUSE_SECURE_PASSWORD`
  - `REDIS_PASSWORD`
  - `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`

### 2. Network Security
- [ ] Use Docker secrets for sensitive data instead of environment variables
- [ ] Consider using a dedicated network for the application
- [ ] Implement SSL/TLS certificates for nginx
- [ ] Restrict port exposure (only expose necessary ports)

### 3. Database Security
- [ ] Enable ClickHouse authentication
- [ ] Use strong passwords for database connections
- [ ] Implement database backup strategy
- [ ] Enable Redis authentication

### 4. Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Configure log rotation
- [ ] Set up centralized logging
- [ ] Configure alerts for security events
- [ ] Monitor resource usage

### 5. Additional Security Measures
- [ ] Run containers as non-root user
- [ ] Use security scanning tools on container images
- [ ] Implement rate limiting at the reverse proxy level
- [ ] Regular security updates for base images

## Files Modified

1. `/.env` - Fixed syntax error, secured permissions
2. `/enhanced-gateway-scraper/.env` - Updated with production values, secured permissions
3. `/enhanced-gateway-scraper/docker-compose.yml` - Updated to use environment variables
4. `/enhanced-gateway-scraper/backups/` - Created backup directory

## Next Steps

1. Generate strong passwords for all placeholder values
2. Consider implementing Docker secrets for sensitive data
3. Configure SSL certificates for nginx
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Implement regular backup procedures
6. Review and test the deployment in a staging environment first
